# manualClassifier
A tool for manually classifying images

# Requires
X-Windows

Set up directory structure like:

```
.
├── original
├── output
├── public
└── thumbs
```

There are scripts for moving stuff to public and resizing thumbs...
You ought to check them though because the paths on these scripts might not be quite right...
